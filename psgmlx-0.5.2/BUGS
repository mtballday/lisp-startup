*** psgmlx Bugs ***


- Emacs21:

        Problem:    When switching themes, neither the cursor nor the mouse
                    pointer update properly. 
        Workaround: Create new frame(s) after changing themes. 

        Problem:    Sometimes chokes on XSL stylesheets. Not sure why. 



- WinNT:

        Problem: The test script is likely to fail.

        Workaround: Install Cygwin and see that Bash and Emacs are properly 
                    configured using the cywin32-mount.el package. 
                    See the instructions at the NTSGML site:
