README for psgmlx 0.4
$Id: README,v 1.1.1.1 2007/04/20 13:10:54 rich Exp $

psgmlx is a collection of customizations and extensions for psgml that
make it easy and user-friendly to edit xml and sgml documents. 

I tried to create something that automates the installation, but that 
isn't too complex for an inexperienced emacs user to understand and configure.

I've only tested the setup with FSF/GNU Emacs, versions 20.7 and 21.2.
