INSTALL for psgmlx 0.4

Installation Instructions:

The main installation tasks are byte-compiling the source files, 
and telling Emacs how to find the installation directory.

You can easily test the package before you decide to edit your .emacs 
file by executing the "test" script.


Installation Step I: the "test" script
==========================================

1. Uncompress the tarball somewhere. Rename it if you want.

2. Change into the psgmlx directory. 

3. (a) Installation Via the "test" Script  

   Execute the "test" script: ./test
        
   What the test script does: 

        First, it calls emacs in batch-mode to byte compile most of
        the source files. Ignore the warnings.

        Next, it starts a fresh copy of emacs and loads some sample
        files in new frames with new X resource settings.
        Furthermore, each frame displays one of the SGML color themes,
        which are part pf the package..

        Change themes using the "Color Themes" menu under "SGML".

   
   (b) Installation WITHOUT the Script

        If you don't (or can't) run the test script, you can easily 
        do the steps by hand.      
 
        i.  CD into the psgmlx directory with your favorite terminal.

        ii. Read the "test" script and do the compilation steps with
            shell commands, or by loading and coompiling the files
            through Emacs.

        iii. Have emacs load the samples and new X resources, skipping
             your regular .emacs stuff:

      "emacs -q -l lib/load-samples.el -xrm '#include "dot-Xresources"' "


Additional Steps for Regular Use
================================

Add psgmlx to Emacs Startup
---------------------------

4. Tell Emacs how to find psgmlx. Add a snippet to your .emacs:

        (setq psgmlxpath "path-to-psgmlx-directory")
        (load (concat psgmlxpath "/init"))

           The path should NOT have a trailing slash.
   
           For example, if you untarred it in your home 
           directory and didn't change its name, you'd have
 
                (setq psgmlxpath "~/psgmlx-0.3")
                (load (concat psgmlxpath "/init"))

          The dot-emacs.el file has the same info.


Optional: Modify your X Resources
---------------------------------

5. Add the dot-Xresources stuff to your .Xresources file.  Run "xrdb
   ~/.Xresources"
 


Customization
-------------

6. Miscellaneous Settings:

        The stuff in "misc-settings.el" is loaded in the demo, but not
        by default. To always load this file at start-up, put the
        following in your .emacs, BEFORE you load psgmlx-init:

                (setq misc-settings t)

7. Windows Keyboard Bindings/Shortcuts

        If you want windows-style CUT, COPY, PASTE, and UNDO keyboard
        commands, put the following in your .emacs BEFORE you load
        psgmlx-init:

                (setq winkeys t)

8. Default Color-Theme

        Edit "default-color-theme.el" to select what you wamt, or put
        it's content in your .emacs. This stuff must go AFTER you load
        psgmlx-init, when emacs will know where to find things.


9. Color-Themes

        You can change color themes at anytime while in sgml-mode by
        choosing a different theme from the "Color Themes" submenu of
        the "SGML" menu.

        Note: Emacs21 users will want to make new frames after
        changing to a theme other than the default. The cursor and
        mouse pointer don't update properly. (Could be my fault...)



SGML Configuration
------------------

10. If your system uses SGML catalogs, psgmlx assumes that the root
    sgml catalog file is "/etc/sgml/catalog". If you wish to change
    this setting, put the following in your .emacs file:

            (setq sgml-catalog-files '("path-to-catalog-file"))
 
     Since I've provided the xml declaration (xml.dcl in lib), you
     won't need to set that variable.


11. Menu Configuration: 
        
        You can customize both of the "Insert DTD" and "Custom Markup"
        menus. The files in the conf/psgml/ directory named data-*
        provide examples.


12. Until I have time to write better docs, you'll have to peruse the
    files in the conf directory to do any further customization. You
    shouldn't have any problems, I tried to make a file layout that's
    somewhat clear.

The End.


I did the easy part. The real thanks goes to those who wrote all these
packages. Especially, Lennart Staflin, the author of psgml.
