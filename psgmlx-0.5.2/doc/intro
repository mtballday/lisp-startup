It must've worked, or you wouldn't be reading this...


For the Impatient
=================   

 In sgml-mode & xml-modes:

        -- Right-click in the XML documents to generate popup menus

        -- Change color themes at bottom of the "SGML" menu



For the Less Impatient
======================


Adding psgmlx to Emacs Startup
-----------------------------

Put this snippet in your .emacs:

        (setq psgmlxpath "path-to-psgmlx-directory")
        (load (concat psgmlxpath "/init"))

The path should NOT have a trailing slash. (The dot-emacs.el file has
an example.)


Using the Current X Resources (menubar colors, mainly)
-----------------------------

--== Note: this step is no longer recommended ==--

        Add the dot-Xresources stuff to your .Xresources file.  Run
        "xrdb ~/.Xresources"
 

Customization
-------------

  -Miscellaneous Settings:

        The settings you are using in this test-drive were loaded from
        the "misc-settings.el" file, but are not loaded by
        default. You can load them at startup by putting the following
        line in your .emacs, BEFORE you load psgmlx-init:

                (setq misc-settings t)

  -Windows Keyboard Bindings/Shortcuts:

        If you want windows-style CUT, COPY, PASTE, and UNDO keyboard
        commands, put the following in your .emacs BEFORE you load
        psgmlx-init:

                (setq winkeys t)

  -Default Color-Theme:

        Edit "default-color-theme.el" to select what you wamt, or put
        it's content in your .emacs. This stuff must go AFTER you load
        psgmlx-init, when emacs will know where to find things.

  -Color-Themes:

        You can change color themes at anytime while in sgml-mode by
        choosing a different theme from the "Color Themes" submenu of
        the "SGML" menu.

        Note: Emacs21 users will want to make new frames after
        changing to a theme other than the default. The cursor and
        mouse pointer don't update properly. (Could be my fault...)



SGML Configuration
------------------

        If your system uses SGML catalogs, psgmlx assumes that the
        root sgml catalog file is "/etc/sgml/catalog". If you wish to
        change this setting, put the following in your .emacs file:

            (setq sgml-catalog-files '("path-to-catalog-file"))
 

        Since I've provided the xml declaration (xml.dcl in lib), you
        won't need to set that variable.


SGML Menu Configuration: 
------------------------        

        You can customize both of the "Insert DTD" and "Custom Markup"
        menus. The examples in conf/psgml/menu-data will show you how.




        'Hope all these frames aren't too annoying...
